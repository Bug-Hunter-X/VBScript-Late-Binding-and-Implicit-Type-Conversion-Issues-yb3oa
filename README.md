This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript: unexpected behavior due to late binding and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.vbs` file contains code that exhibits this issue. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with explicit type checking and early binding where appropriate.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in VBScript to avoid runtime surprises.
