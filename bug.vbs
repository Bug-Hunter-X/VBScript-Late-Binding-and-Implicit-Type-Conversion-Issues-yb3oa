Late Binding and Implicit Type Conversion: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors that are hard to track down during development.  For example, if you try to use a method on an object that doesn't support it, you might not get an error until runtime.  Implicit type conversion can also cause unexpected results, especially when dealing with strings and numbers.
